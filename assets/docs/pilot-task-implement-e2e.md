# PILOT task — Write the end-to-end test

Injected by `.claude/skills/pilot-dev/SKILL.md` into the `pilot-e2e` persona's prompt,
for a `type:e2e` task (`docs/pilot-link-e2e-tasks.md` — never inherited from the story
it belongs to), **alongside `docs/pilot-task-implement.md`** — everything there applies as
written (claim, reclaim/deviation/`needs-human`/`on-hold` mechanics, final self-review,
PR/template/`status:review-ready` handoff, doc updates) except the two differences
below.

You receive one `type:e2e` task, already claimed (`status:in-dev`) by the skill, whose
spec (phase 3) names the story's flow to exercise. It depends ("Depends on #N") on *every*
dev task in its split, not a subset — all of them already merged, or the ticket
wouldn't have cleared the dependency gate to reach you.

1. Write the test against that real, already-merged, integrated behavior, covering every
   case of the flow worth exercising (one test file/`describe` block with several cases,
   not a single happy-path assertion) — **never mock the integration points the test
   exists to exercise** (a mocked-out e2e test verifies nothing new). Use whatever e2e
   tooling/framework this project's docs/CI already establish; don't introduce a second
   one without cause.
2. Unlike `docs/pilot-task-implement.md` step 3, there's no red-green-refactor cycle here
   ordinarily: you're verifying behavior that already exists across your dependencies,
   not creating new behavior. Run the test and confirm it passes against the real,
   current system — that's your evidence, not a failing-commit-first history.
3. If running it surfaces a genuine defect in that already-merged code — not a gap in
   your own ticket's scope — follow `docs/pilot-task-implement.md` step 3a exactly: originate a
   `type:bug` ticket (`docs/pilot-link-bug-tickets.md`), link it ("Blocks #M"/"Depends on
   #N"), then unclaim yours (push what you have to a branch, comment naming it, clear the
   assignee, back to `status:dev-ready`) — never push a broken or partial commit; your
   ticket can't be marked done with a test that doesn't actually pass.
4. Otherwise, continue exactly as `docs/pilot-task-implement.md` describes from step 4
   onward: implement per the spec, run validation, final self-review (step 5a),
   commit/push/open the PR per this project's template, clear the assignee and move
   the ticket to `status:review-ready`, and update any affected docs.

You are not a phase-5 reviewer, same as `pilot-dev` — phase 5 for your ticket is whichever
reviewer set `pilot-review/SKILL.md` assigns `type:e2e` (PM + architect +
tech lead, same as `type:feature`; the PM reads your test to confirm the split validates
the story's real flow). You also have no role in phase 6, the separate human QA gate
(`docs/pilot-process.md` §7) — that's `pilot-qa`'s job, on the story ticket, once every
task (including yours) is merged.
